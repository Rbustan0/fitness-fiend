# fitness-fiend

Focus on your fitness goals while these nerds figure out how to track it!

## Description

Fitness Fiend is a fitness tracker web application that is designed to help users track their fitness goals and progres.  The app will allowe users to creat an account, set fitness goals, and track their progress through creating and tracking their workouts and meals.  The app will provide users with the ability to visualize their progress and stay motivated.  Fitness Fiend also allows users to edit or delete their workouts and meals if they need to update their tracking. By securely logging in and out and protecting user data, the app provides a secure and private way for users to track their fitness progress.

We were motivated to create Fitness Fiend to fulfill our user story of wanting an app that allows users to create an account and log in to track their fitness goals and progress. 

Based on the user story and acceptance criteria provided, Fitness Fiend solves the problem of helping users track their workouts and meals all in one place so that they can stay on top of their progress while keeping their eye on their fitness goals. It provides users with a platform to set their fitness goals, track their workouts and meals, and view their progress over time through charts. Overall, the app helps users stay motivated to achieve and attain their set fitness goals.  

We learned how to apply our technical skills such as using Handlebars.js for rendering views, using Express for backend logic, using Sequelize for interacting with the database, incorporating Chart.js into functionality, following the MVC paradigm for organization, using express-session and cookies to authenticate users and protect user data, and protecting sensitive information using dotenv. 

We also learned how to understand user needs and preferences by becoming the user as we created that app knowing that we had to provide users with a platform to set fitness goals, track workouts and meals and viewing progress over a period of time.  This resulted in us creating multiple front end javascript pages to match respective handlebars layouts.  We also incorportated the importance of securely logging in and out of the app, protecting user data, and responding appropriately to GET and POST requests. Finally, creating this app provided an opportunity to test and refine the app based on user feedback, and learn about best practices for creating effective and engaging fitness tracking apps.

Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future. And if your project is deployed, make sure to include a link to the deployed application so people can see it in action!


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
A GitHub profile with consistently high-quality README files is sure to help you stand out among the crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub, so make sure you give these important files the time and attention they deserve.
