Focus on your fitness goals while these nerds figure out how to track it!

## Description

Fitness Fiend is a fitness tracker web application that is designed to help users track their fitness goals and progres.  The app will allow users to create an account, set fitness goals, and track their progress through creating and tracking their workouts and meals.  The app will provide users with the ability to visualize their progress and stay motivated.  Fitness Fiend also allows users to edit or delete their workouts and meals if they need to update their tracking. By securely logging in and out and protecting user data, the app provides a secure and private way for users to track their fitness progress.

We were motivated to create Fitness Fiend to fulfill our user story of wanting an app that allows users to create an account and log in to track their fitness goals and progress. 

Based on the user story and acceptance criteria provided, Fitness Fiend solves the problem of helping users track their workouts and meals all in one place so that they can stay on top of their progress while keeping their eye on their fitness goals. It provides users with a platform to set their fitness goals, track their workouts and meals, and view their progress over time through charts. Overall, the app helps users stay motivated to achieve and attain their set fitness goals.  

We learned how to apply our technical skills such as using Handlebars.js for rendering views, using Express for backend logic, using Sequelize for interacting with the database, incorporating Chart.js into functionality, following the MVC paradigm for organization, using express-session and cookies to authenticate users and protect user data, and protecting sensitive information using dotenv. 

We also learned how to understand user needs and preferences by becoming the user as we created that app knowing that we had to provide users with a platform to set fitness goals, track workouts and meals and viewing progress over a period of time.  This resulted in us creating multiple front end javascript pages to match respective handlebars layouts.  We also incorportated the importance of securely logging in and out of the app, protecting user data, and responding appropriately to GET and POST requests. Finally, creating this app provided an opportunity to test and refine the app based on user feedback, and learn about best practices for creating effective and engaging fitness tracking apps.

Some challenges we faced were connecting our backend routes to the front end handlebars. Implementing chart.js was a challenge in creating a chart that would total the sum of our data from different pages.   

Ideas for future development: 
- Add workout playlist
- Social media integration
- Motivational quotes everytime you login
- Provide personalized recommendations
- Gamification
- Syncs with existing fitness tracking devices
